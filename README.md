## Reqs

Chess

Training should be fast
  - I should be able to train 20 example games in about 30 minutes overall (using cuda)
  -	If this means we need to truncate games at move depth and count points
  - 'continue' training (i.e. load an existing model and start training from there)

Future feature
- You should evaluate the ELO level of your model, play it against stockfish and then dial tune the stockfish to find the threshold where your model begins to lose. That way you can find the correct ELO level for it.

Well thought out menu
	Think of user use cases with this system
	
	loading model
		training
			continued
		playing
		evaluating
			stockfish
	
	Update the code to have the model ask to save csv after saving the model state, default is y for both

Requirements:
  - Python
  - Uses the python-chess library for move generation and validation
  - MCTS to efficiently explore game tree
    - sample score weighted permutations until checkmate
	  - see scoring method below
	  - should also allow for non score purely random move (outside of the scored potential moves)
	    - this will ensure the game isn't only learning the rule (symbolic) based policy
    - possible moves
    - handles exponential explosion of move possibilities
  - Reinforcement Learning: State-action-reward triplets for Q-learning or policy gradients
    - deep [q learning] neural network to guide the search (similar to AlphaZero's approach)
	  - Differentiates between phyrric victory and not
	- learns over mcts selected for permutations of possibilities rather than exhaustive
	- learns within games based on score
	- final outcome is score * checkmate status (interaction).
	- 2 opportunities to learn (from both sides).
      - the game learn effectively from two vantage points (each player is like it’s own ‘view’ of the q-learning process.  I.e. what moves were favorable to one side vs disfavorable to the other, and this rotates back and forth).  This should simply be an index operation on the tensor of past moves (i.e. odd, even).
  - Implements a scoring hueristic
  - tensor of board
    - game as a set of 2d tensor's of board positions extended with moves
      - a time series sequence to sequence problem (best path of moves)
	- CUDA
	  - Parallelization
	  - mcts search using descending phi ratio’s could be done in parallel somehow (i.e. top 21 moves running parallel 13 moves and those 13 running parallel 8, etc)
  - uses python libraries for valid chess moves
- ask an llm to do the deep learning over the q agent for me
- that part is fuzzy.  I just know standard q learning is exponentially expensive.
- q learning objective (loss function?):
    - checkmate opponent in the least amount of moves (min)
    - with max score
- Status bar showing # of moves iterated over in current game
- Cap trainng steps (i.e. evaluted moves) per game at n (default 100, -1 is no cap), that's 50 white, 50 black.
- After training, when playing the game, use a visual map of the chess board
- Board
  - use a common python library
Playing
- threats are highlighted in light red on the board
- when a player inputs a piece coordinate for a move, when the player inputs the first two characters (would be nice if they merely type it in, vs hit enter).  the piece is highlighted in yellow, and all available moves are highlighted in green, secondary moves (two moves out) are highlighted in light orange
- how what pieces are guarded, this could be light green
- what areas are under threat should be a light red (not just what pieces are under threat, but what areas if moved into would create a threat immediately due to those areas being guarded).  I suppose on the flip side, we should also what areas are guarded (not just what pieces).  So we should extend the light green guarded pieces logic to light green guarded areas, and light red would be areas under threat (to include pieces under threat).  that would make things much simpler.
- have the board clickable be clickable in addition to the ability to input move coordinates
- the ability to save a game
- continue from a saved game
- user can request a move hint (as if assuming the policy model), we can call this 'policy model hint'
- white should always be on the bottom
- the ability to undo a move (such as making a mistake such as releasing a click too early, or more pragmatically didn't see a blind spot)
- score tracking
  - what I would like to see is the score for each player printed each game move, left padded up to thousands place if in that format, else as a percent
  - also would like to see a plot of the scores for player a and b inbetween each game turn (fine to update the same plot rather than a new plot).
 - and finally, at the end of the training, have a plot of all final scores (including draws) of each game plotted over game iterations.

better, but I'm rethinking these variations on threatened pieces/spaces.

I think red should simply mean any place an opponent's piece could take in 1 move (space or piece)

and light red is within 2 moves

from a players perspective, movement should be green, light green 2 steps out

so how do we do both (contested areas?).  I would think we simply half/half the shades (if we can split diagonally).

Advanced agent learning
	hybrid approach that combines elements of online learning, regret minimization, and exploitation-focused sampling. It's quite similar to how strong human players learn - they might make a move, immediately see it was a mistake, mentally "take it back," and then make a better move.

	Undo mechanics
		
	do you think adding the ability for the deep q learning system to have the ability to do up to n undo moves makes sense to help the policy model 'learn'.  I mean... tbh, ai/policy model when playing shouldn't have the ability to do an 'undo', but if the policy model can learn (i.e. apply the calculating loss of point lesson from their move), and improve upon the search space by essentially doubling there search options (former possible moves + a new set of moves), but also only allow the policy model to undo say 3 moves an entire game.

	One this is all theory, two I'd prefer the proposed change to be as 'light' as possible, and finally, I'm not sure if it's even necessary for a deep q learning which will eventually see a majority of the potential move action space from basically training.  But this would allow for a dynamic way for the model to have an 'aha' learning moment by say having a heuristic (i.e. no agents) that when game points suffer a dramatic shift, that one of the 'undo' moves would be triggered, and the deep q learning agent would learn from their most recent 'mistake' and be able to undo it to essentially double their move option space (i.e. take former moves + a new set of moves derived that exclude the former initial moves, i.e. mask them out of the possible move space, then the agent does a 'double' take on the possible moves they can decide upon).

	Of course these aha moments would be one 'trigger', but sometimes I find myself wanting to undo a move when I made a mistake, not necessarily lost a lot of points.  This is more complex, as internally I'm looking into the future I was hoping for, and a mistake cost me that loss in game points I was expecting to achieve.  Mathematically, this would involve me forecasting (inferring) future move state spaces and their associated points and a mistake had me realize I lost those potential points... so this is more advanced as it involves calculating future move states and their associated points (something WE ARE ALREADY DOING more or less / essentially with the phi based mcts).
	
	the beauty about the aha moment is it only needs to be a 1 move deep learning lesson

	once the move is made and the points calculated (which the deep q learning agent is basically ALREADY doing with the phi based forecasting), the agent can be like 'whoops, I didn't mean to suffer those losses.

	So in effect, we don't really need the ability to backtrack, but rather an option to expand the search space... well actually, the agent isn't using a greedy policy, but rather is using a sampled policy, so the agent can still make a 'mistake', but it's still an informed mistake (simply based on probability), but would allow the agent to 'undo' a 'bad move' more or less, so maybe I am back to what I was proposing since we are sampling and not doing greedy (I was thinking we could just have a cutoff).

	That's it.  If an agent randomly selects a move that would result in a loss of points more than a certain threshold, this triggers a lesson learned for q learning on what that move state would have resulted in, and the ability to do an 'undo', but the undo has to be valuable in terms of offering a better move.  Basically the agent would only select a move with a score higher than the one they are undoing from the new concatenated sampling space (prior move space (masked) + new thought out move space (remaining unmasked), and the probability space is limited to just moves above the former probability (thereby avoiding a secondary undo).  So this 'undo' mechanism would trigger automatically as long as a player hasn't done an undo already in that turn, and has available undo's.  The key here though is to let the q learning agent learn from this 'mistake' immediately, and then follow-up with a new state sampling from this updated search space.

	I'm not even sure what to call this, but it seems like a type of learning I've done during chess, kind of a mix between monte carlo sampling and genetic algorithms (evolving) to mimick learning from trial and error.

	I suppose we would need to account for when there is no move above such a loss threshold.  For example.  If an undo is triggered, and the new state is just the same scores or worse... we can avoid this problem efficiently by ensuring that the threshold is hit, if there were no other moves available above that threshold.  Then we can double the search space, but if still no available move is better (e.g. such as late game situations with only 2 or 3 pieces left)... then we are stuck with that move.

	I just realized I have a similar issue with the mistake rule checking.  If a change in game state results in too big of a jump, we second guess the sampling and try again.  However late game situations might make this impossible to not double check (up to 3 checks total per game, no more than one per turn).  However, if a move would result in a check, this doesn't necessarily mean the following moves are suboptimal, this might be a necessary situation to get to a more advantageous game state.  This would require knowledge of following states.  I suppose the litmus (heuristic) test here would be if the resulting end game state (score of the final phi layer) is not of a lower game state than the initial, then we don't need to 'double guess' ourselves

ascii piece_symbols (monospace) = {
	'P': '♙', 'N': '♘', 'B': '♗', 'R': '♖', 'Q': '♕', 'K': '♔',
	'p': '♟', 'n': '♞', 'b': '♝', 'r': '♜', 'q': '♛', 'k': '♚'

Scoring
	UCB Score
		also, this isn't useful scoring imo.  The point of scoring is to track the state of the board (pieces, positions, advantage, etc), using some common standard scoring metric like UCB (UBC?).
	
	https://chessify.me/blog/chess-engine-evaluation
	
	I think the engine would be better if we did q learning on sampling from mcts where higher scores 

	think of it as a rag retrieval and these are these scores are the sparse embeddings but we treat this like a sampler (a mcts sampler). 

	generate
		21 possible moves
			derive scores (to include material, coordination, etc)
			weighted sample 13
			repeat thru the rest of phi
			
			this should help the model choose every possible move, while reducing the overall space of the computation

	Scoring as embeddings sampler for bootstrapping a non naive policy and/or random (not sure which one to use it for, but I figured using scoring vs pure random will explore better moves and the policy will update faster
					
	Material: the number and value of pieces on the board
	Mobility: the ability of pieces to move around the board
	King safety: how vulnerable the kings are
	Pawn structure: the configuration of pawns on the board
	Control of space: which side controls more of the board
	Piece coordination: how well the pieces work together

	I think counting unthreatened pieces as well as enemy threatened pieces towards the active player as a benefit makes sense. Piece mobility (i.e. board control into unthreatened areas). King safety such as free moves. All of this can be 1 move deep. Idk how to track pawn structure and or piece coordination?
	
	I wish there was a way to more intelligently pick what pieces to explore moves from rather than simply 25 random initial moves. Maybe give preference to certain classes of pieces and maybe a strategy to bifurcate between non threatened vs threatened. For example if the game is known to aim for certain strategies. Then weight rank those strategies for random selection (such as addressing a high material  point threatened piece, so maybe that piece is initially weighted higher for mcts explorations)

tracking material point scores
I would think on another axis having this shown as well within that same plot would be useful.

what about other scores?  Does it make sense to plot those inbetween games as well (as well as printing at the end of all games)?

when I said at the end 'the printing over all games', this should be a single time series plot my end of game metrics (just as we are plotting scores over a game iteration, we take the final values, and plot these across training iterations across games) (i.e. one point aggregated from each game), this will hopefully show how trends are improving over long term training objectives are reached (new minima's, maxima's, etc)

I DON'T WANT TO SEE OVERRIDDEN SCORES FROM CHECKMATES.  Give me the score minus any checkmate modification.  Some relative score that is comparable across all games.

I have concerns the model was trained with these more or less 'jury rigged' scores (i.e. the ones I just spoke about) as they don't really offer a meaningful comparison.  The score without any checkmate modification is the final game signal.  That's what we are tracking, not some 'this + this value = end of game'.  I'm not sure how to express this, but if we think of this as a tensor problem, we are simply measuring what the conditions were at an end of game condition (i.e. analogous to a text prompt/chunk)

	I likely inadvertently removed the checkmate reward signal while doing mcts searches.  The scoring is to help navigate search space, but what really matters is checkmating the opponent.
	
	the above 2 pars
		I DON'T WANT ... a text prompt/chunk)
	
	I think I made a mistake in removing the checkmate status in scoring.  While yes that's the score I want to see during end of game, but for q learning.  It's likely needed to exemplify end of game conditions and highly sought for and not based on score alone (else q learning is learning to mimic underlying score minus chekmate status).

	So when searching through the phi layered mcts approach, if a checkmate is found, that should be a sought after goal, and my concern is this feature 



Efficient MCTS: scaling descent russian doll mcts
	Methods to speed things up
	normal q learning involves free exploration vs optimal path.  the purpose of the scores as embedding sampler is to give the q learning a leg up in learning faster (to act as a policy) while the model develops it's own policy but doesn't start from scratch.  I would think the basics would still be random selection vs optimal policy.
	
	say
	the original code was calculating points 25 moves in from mcts and choosing the best options as a default move.  the q learning would simply learn from this move.
	
	idk, maybe I'm over analyzing this, but I figured the space is exponential

	so I was trying to figure out a way to pair down the computational graph, but I'd prefer a more abstract deep learning approach if I could, but mcts is the best idea I have mixed with a sampled sparse embedding approach (i.e. scores with mcts).

	then these moves are made and the q-learning model updated.

	...
	Why Your Russian Doll MCTS Approach Is Superior

	Guided Exploration vs. Pure Randomness

	Your approach: Systematically explores ~25 moves at each level, with each move evaluated and sampled based on promise
	Random approach: Would waste computational resources on clearly inferior moves

	Depth Efficiency

	Your approach: "21 randomly possible next moves → 13 from each of those → 8 from 13 → 5 from 8 → 3 from 5 → 2 from 3 → 1 from 2"
	This creates a narrowing funnel that concentrates computation where it matters
	Pure random exploration might never reach promising lines

	Bootstrapping Effect

	The comprehensive evaluation function we've built (material, mobility, king safety, etc.) provides excellent guidance
	Early in training, this evaluation serves as domain knowledge to jumpstart learning
	The MCTS sampling based on this evaluation is much more informative than random moves

	Knowledge Transfer

	Your approach allows for transferring chess knowledge through the evaluation function and search process
	Random play would force the DQN to learn basic chess principles from scratch

	Implementation Changes
	Here's what I would modify in the code to fully embrace your Russian doll MCTS approach:

	```

	pythondef select_move(self, board, training_progress=0.0):
		"""
		Always use MCTS for move selection, but with dynamic iterations
		based on training progress and position complexity
		"""
		# Calculate complexity of position
		complexity = self.estimate_position_complexity(board)
		
		# Determine MCTS iterations based on training progress and complexity
		# Early in training: more iterations (exploration)
		# Later in training: fewer iterations (exploitation of learned policy)
		base_iterations = 300 if training_progress < 0.3 else (
						  200 if training_progress < 0.7 else 100)
		
		# Add more iterations for complex positions
		iterations = int(base_iterations * (0.8 + 0.4 * complexity))
		
		# Always use MCTS with the calculated number of iterations
		return self.select_move_with_mcts(board, iterations, training_progress)
	And modify the epsilon decay to apply to MCTS exploration parameter instead:
	pythondef select_move_with_mcts(self, board, iterations=100, training_progress=0.0):
		"""
		Select a move using MCTS guided by the hybrid evaluation function
		"""
		# Adjust UCB exploration weight based on training progress
		# Higher early in training, lower later
		exploration_weight = max(1.6 * (1 - 0.5 * training_progress), 0.8)
		
		# Adjust sampling width at each level based on training progress
		# More samples early in training, fewer later
		samples_per_level = [
			max(25, int(30 * (1 - 0.3 * training_progress))),  # Level 1
			max(15, int(20 * (1 - 0.3 * training_progress))),  # Level 2
			max(10, int(13 * (1 - 0.3 * training_progress))),  # Level 3
			max(7, int(10 * (1 - 0.3 * training_progress))),   # Level 4
			max(5, int(7 * (1 - 0.3 * training_progress))),    # Level 5
			max(3, int(5 * (1 - 0.3 * training_progress))),    # Level 6
			max(2, int(3 * (1 - 0.3 * training_progress)))     # Level 7
		]
		
		# Create a modified MCTS that uses the narrowing sample approach
		mcts = RussianDollMCTS(board, iterations=iterations, 
							  exploration_weight=exploration_weight,
							  samples_per_level=samples_per_level)
		return mcts.search()
	And then implement the RussianDollMCTS class to handle the narrowing exploration pattern:
	pythonclass RussianDollMCTS(MCTS):
		def __init__(self, root_board, iterations=1000, exploration_weight=1.41, samples_per_level=None):
			super().__init__(root_board, iterations, exploration_weight)
			# Default narrowing pattern if not specified
			self.samples_per_level = samples_per_level or [25, 13, 8, 5, 3, 2, 1]
		
		def simulate(self, board, depth=0):
			"""
			Enhanced simulation that uses narrowing samples at each level
			"""
			if depth >= len(self.samples_per_level) or board.is_game_over():
				# End of sampling depth or terminal position
				if board.is_checkmate():
					return 0.0 if board.turn == chess.WHITE else 1.0
				return 0.5  # Draw
			
			# Get all legal moves
			legal_moves = list(board.legal_moves)
			if not legal_moves:
				return 0.5  # No legal moves, draw
			
			# Number of moves to sample at this level
			samples = min(self.samples_per_level[depth], len(legal_moves))
			
			# Score each move
			scored_moves = []
			for move in legal_moves:
				next_board = board.copy()
				next_board.push(move)
				# Use our comprehensive evaluation
				score = evaluate_position(next_board)
				scored_moves.append((move, score))
			
			# Sort by score (optimal for current player)
			scored_moves.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=(board.turn == chess.WHITE))
			
			# Take top samples
			top_moves = [move for move, _ in scored_moves[:samples]]
			
			# Select a random move from top candidates
			move = random.choice(top_moves)
			next_board = board.copy()
			next_board.push(move)
			
			# Recursive simulation to next level
			result = self.simulate(next_board, depth + 1)
			
			# Flip result since we're alternating perspectives
			return 1.0 - result
	```
	Advantages Over Epsilon-Greedy Approach
	The traditional epsilon-greedy approach used in Q-learning doesn't map well to chess because:

	Pure random exploration is wasteful: Chess has ~35 legal moves on average, and most are terrible
	Low information signal: Random moves lead to poor positions that provide little useful learning
	Sparse rewards: Checkmates are rare events in random play, making learning slow

	Your Russian doll MCTS approach fixes all these issues by concentrating exploration on promising branches while still allowing for sufficient variety to discover new strategies.
	Conclusion
	I completely agree with your insight. The Russian doll MCTS approach will indeed almost always help rather than using purely random moves. It provides a perfect balance between:

	Exploration: Sampling multiple paths at each level
	Exploitation: Using evaluation to guide which paths to explore
	Efficiency: Concentrating computation on promising variations
	Knowledge transfer: Leveraging chess principles through evaluation functions

	This approach is particularly well-suited to chess, which has an enormous state space but also strong heuristics about what constitutes good play. The combination of MCTS sampling guided by your comprehensive evaluation function creates a powerful bootstrapping mechanism for the DQN to learn much faster than it could with random exploration.
